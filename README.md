## Description
There is a theory in social science that people adopt similar patterns of language use when they interact. In this project, we will investigate if this concept is evident using data from an online forum. Some preliminary analysis is first done to determine the predictors of which we would use to analyse and justify our data. After which we’ll discuss the following topics. Firstly, we will find out if the sentiments expressed in language are different between threads. Secondly, this report will investigate if the language used by the most active members are different to that used by other members who aren’t as active.
